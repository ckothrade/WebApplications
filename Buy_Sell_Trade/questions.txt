QUESTIONS:

1) why does admin->getPosts need to be an admin feature?
  - The admin getPosts method retrieves the posts created by user

2) What is difference between controllers/board.js    getIndex() & getPosts() ?  
  - The getIndex is the generic landing page, but getPosts has a pathway to it, 
  although they are identical in design.

3) Do i need to remove my authorized email from sendmail on controllers/auth -> postReset()    ?
