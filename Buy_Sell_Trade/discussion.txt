fs.createReadStream: vid 329
Node doesnt have to preload the data, it just streams it directly to the writable response object 
using the pipe() method. This is great for larger files as node doesnt process the data and the 
browser can just handle the processing of data in steps however it was designed to.


file uploads:
files should not be stored in the database? too large and to expensive to query. Store path to file or a reference in db.

- Server Status Codes:
 Our app doesnt set too many status codes as we redirect often, whcih would overwrite us setting the status. Unlike a restful api, where it is more important to set status codes. 


mail server:
NodeJS & express are not frameworks meant to be used to write mail servers. Mail servers are very complex, which is why we use a 3rd party service.
